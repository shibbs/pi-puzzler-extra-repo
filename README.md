Hello and welcome to the puzzler extra repository!

This is a repo for the pi puzzler that contains the code needed to pass one of the levels

In order to pass this level you'll have to read this readme as well as run the code. When you are done you will run the code which will give you an output. However in order to pass the level(s) you will need to add on "-readme" to what you enter to pass the level(s).
